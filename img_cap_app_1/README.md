# Image Captioning Project

This project demonstrates how to generate captions for images using the BLIP model (`Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`) from Hugging Face. It includes scripts for local image captioning, a Gradio-based web app, and automated captioning of images scraped from web pages.

## Features

- **Gradio Web App**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for image captioning.
- **Web Image Captioning**: Automates the process of scraping images from a webpage and generating captions for them.
- **Local Image Captioning**: Generate captions for locally stored images.
- **Hugging Face Space**: Try out the Gradio app live: [Image Captioning App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kelex83/Caption_images).

## File Overview

1. image_captioning.ipynb: Google colab implementation.

2. image_cap.py

A script to generate captions for a single image file.

- Usage: Update img_path with the path to your image and run the script:
   ```bash
   python image_cap.py

- Example Output:
   ```bash
   "A horse running in a grassy field."

3. image_captioning_app.py

A Gradio-based web app for captioning images interactively.

- Usage: Run the script:
   ```bash
   python image_captioning_app.py

Open the displayed URL in your browser to upload an image and generate a caption.

4. automate_url_captioner.py

A script to scrape images from a webpage, caption them, and save the captions to a text file.

- Usage: Update the url variable with the webpage URL and run:
   ```bash
   python automate_url_captioner.py

Captions will be saved to captions.txt.

5. img_cap_local_files.py

A script to scrape images from your local files, caption them, and save the captions to a text file.

- Usage: Update the url variable with the path to your local images and run:
   ```bash
   python img_cap_local_files.py


## Testing the Application

You can test the app directly via the Hugging Face Space where you can upload an image or enter an image url and it will generate a downloadable caption:

[Hugging Face Space - Caption Images](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kelex83/Caption_images).

Alternatively, clone this repository and run any of the scripts locally as per the instructions above.

## Hugging Face Space

The app has been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, providing an easy way to interact with the model online. The configuration for the Space is defined in the README.md file and associated metadata.
