## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple web application that allows users to upload documents and receive responses generated by an LLM. The project demonstrates the interaction between a frontend interface and a backend service.

---

## Features
- Upload custom documents for processing.
- Receive responses generated by a Large Language Model.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.
- Optional deployment to a web server for broader access.

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python is beneficial but not required.
- Access to the IBM Skills Network Cloud IDE.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-for-your-data
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the web interface.

3. Upload a document and interact with the chatbot.

## Running the Application Using Docker

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image using the following command. This will create a Docker image tagged as `build_chatbot_for_your_data`:
   ```bash
   docker build . -t build_chatbot_for_your_data
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   Once the image is built, you can run the container in the foreground on port `8000` using the command below. This will start the application and make it accessible at `http://localhost:8000`:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 build_chatbot_for_your_data
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the chatbot application.

4. **Rebuilding the Image:**

   If you make changes to the application files and want to test them, you will need to rebuild the Docker image using the `docker build` command again, and then rerun the container.
