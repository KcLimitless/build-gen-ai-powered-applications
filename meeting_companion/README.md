## Installation

1. Create a Python virtual environment

   ```bash
   pip3 install virtualenv 
   virtualenv my_env # create a virtual environment my_env
   source my_env/bin/activate # activate my_env
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   # installing required libraries in my_env
   pip install transformers==4.35.2 torch==2.1.1 gradio==4.44.0 langchain==0.0.343 ibm_watson_machine_learning==1.0.335 huggingface-hub==0.19.4
   
   ```

- Install ffmpeg to be able to work with audio files in python.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
   ```

- I have included a jupyter notebook implementation also: meeting_assistant.ipynb

3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone ...
   cd ...
   ```

Set up environment variables for API keys and other configurations as needed.

## Usage
